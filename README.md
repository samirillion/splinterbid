# Splinter Bid: Bridge is a Partnership Game

Splinter Bid is probably the best thing to happen to the Bridge since Whist.

The client-side of the application is written with Vanilla JS and the server side is written using python's Flask framework by *the* <a href="https://github.com/entquine">Brian Gates</a>.

## Development
Run `python server.py` from the server directory. The python script will tell you to go to `localhost:5000` to view the application.
